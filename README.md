# JavaScript_test

## About

This is a repository I made long time ago just to test some JavaScript. The website is deployed to Github pages and is accessible at <https://www.modokemdev.com/JavaScript_test/>.  

The concept is really annoying as it throws alert after alert. **Really annoying!!** But at least, it shows the concept of alert.

Also, there is a subpath which is accessible at <https://www.modokemdev.com/JavaScript_test/animation>. This page also contains interesting basic JavaScript concepts.  

## For beginners

If you are starting with html/javascript, I really recommend to follow the mozilla tutorial : <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web>. You will build a simple basic website which is kind of what I did here.  

## Deploy to Github Pages

In this repo, the code is automatically deployed to Github pages whenever the code is pushed and merged to master.
